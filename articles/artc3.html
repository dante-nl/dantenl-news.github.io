<h1>3 days until the "Hi, Speed" Apple Event!</h1>
<h2>As you may know, Apple is holding a October event. Here's what I'm hoping for and what's expected</h2>
<p>10 October, 2020. Written by dante_nl</p>

<h3>What I hope for</h3>
<p>AirTags. Just AirTags. When they release in the Netherlands, I'm going to but them, so my bike will be easier to find at school.</p>
<h3>Expected stuff</h3>
<p>4 new iPhones: the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 mini is probably going to have a 5.4 inch display, and will start at $699. It will probably have 2 cameras (wide and ultrawide). You can probably buy it in the colors black, white, red, blue, and green. Storage is probably from 64gb to 256gb.The iPhone 12 will probably have a 6.1 inch display, and the colors are also probably going to be black, white, red, blue, and green, so enough to choose from. Probably will be the same cameras as the mini and the starting price will probably $799. The iPhone 12 Pro will also be a 6.1 inch model, it will come in gold, silver, graphite, and blue, it will also have 3 cameras (wide, ultrawide and telephoto with 4x optical zoom) and a LIDAR sensor for AR, storage will probably start at 128gb and the price at $999.The iPhone 12 Pro Max will probably have a 6.7 inch display, gold, silver, graphite, and blue as colors, 128gb as base storage, it will probably have the same cameras as the iPhone 12 Pro, except it will have a 5x optical telephoto camera instead of 4x. It will probably start at $1,099.</p>

<p>Next: a smaller HomePod. I couldn't find a lot of details about it</p>

<p>AirTags: a small tracker device, that probaby would use Find My to show a location and play a sound whenever it's needed. The price will probably be around $49</p>

<p>AirPods Studio: an over-ear headphone that's probably going to have a feature so it doesn't matter which side you're wearing it!</p>
