<h1>Welcome to dante_nl News!</h1>
<h2>Here's how to use it</h2>
<p>8 October, 2020. Written by dante_nl.</p>

<h3>What to expect?</h3>
<p>You can expect things like announcements, updates, Apple (event) information, RoutineHub updates and things that are also important to share! I also might be writing things about future software updates from Apple, like what's new and my personal experiences! When my dad switches to a Apple Watch Series 6, I can get his Series 5, so expect some articles about that!</p>
<hr>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>As you might have seen on the homepage, you have these boxes:</p>
<div class="box">This is an example box. <a href="#" target="_self">Read article</a></div>
<p>The homepage is mostly used for the most recent announcements. Above that, you'll find a little welcome text, most of the time this is just random text, like "Fortune cookies taste good" or something else random like that. Sometimes they contain useful information like "3 days until the Apple Event!". Kinda like the Minecraft splashtext. If you press "Read article", you automatically get redirected to the article. If you want to go home, press "Home" in the navigation bar. If you want to read more articles, click "All articles". If you want to join the Discord, press "Discord".</p>
